            software functionality quickly and speak to it intelligently. He is
            a self- starter and would take a leading role when called upon.
            Along with his intellect he has an excellent work ethic, always
            willing to participate beyond his role, and learn new skills. I
            highly recommend Jeff in any IT business role as he will bring added
