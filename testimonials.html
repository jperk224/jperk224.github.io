              "Jeff is a natural leader with an inquisitive, incisive mind for
              business. He has proven experience tracking multiple business
              objectives, collaborating with technical and managerial
              stakeholders, and delivering exceptional products. I highly
              recommend him for both his skill and character, and I would be
              happy to work with him again if our paths crossed."

              "I worked with Jeff on multiple large-scale implementations for
              direct banks. I was impressed with his ability to learn complex
              software functionality quickly and speak to it intelligently. He
              is a self- starter and would take a leading role when called upon.
              Along with his intellect he has an excellent work ethic, always
              willing to participate beyond his role, and learn new skills. I
              highly recommend Jeff in any IT business role as he will bring
              added value to the team."

            "Jeff is the type of professional and person that you very rarely
            have an opportunity to meet, get to know, and work with. He
            impressed me when I first met him during his interview and he has
            continued to do so every day ever since. There are many facets of
            his professional persona that I could highly speak of, particularly
            his ability to quickly master very difficult technical concepts and
            his commitment to his team."

            is patient when instructing. Jeff has outstanding communication
            skills and builds close connections with clients. He is truly a
            motivator and an inspiration to me."
