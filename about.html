                recommend him for both his skill and character, and I would be

                I’m an experienced
                <strong>high-performing, analytically-minded</strong> technology
                solution expert. I’m a lifelong learner who readily pursues
                <strong>new challenges and ideas</strong>. I love information
                technology because it allows me to stretch outside of my comfort
                zone to <strong>find success</strong>. I’ve worked in software
                for more than eight years, launching some great and not so great
                products while learning <stong>valuable lessons</stong> along
                the way. I
                <strong>excel in collaborative spaces</strong> executing
                <strong>team first</strong> fundamentals and am motivated by the
                achievements of those around me. I would love to discuss how I
                can help your team succeed.

                direct banks. I was impressed with his ability to learn complex
                software functionality quickly and speak to it intelligently. He
                is a self- starter and would take a leading role when called
                upon. Along with his intellect he has an excellent work ethic,
                always willing to participate beyond his role, and learn new
                skills. I highly recommend Jeff in any IT business role as he
                will bring added value to the team."
